# ANalysis Of Variance (ANOVA)

## Categorical predictor variables

> The aim of this tutorial is to look at one-way ANOVAs in R

Predictor variables can be categorical (called factors in R). The categories can have two or more sub-categories (called levels in R). For example, sex: male/female, level of drug: low/medium/high  

The relationship between a continuous response variable & categorical predictors is analysed using a special case of statistical models: One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  

Confusingly, ANOVA can refer to how data are spread around a single mean (*variance*) and also a way of comparing means (via how similar their variances are) for experimental designs with a predictor variable with any number of levels. But let's start at a simple case of a Fixed one-way ANOVA with 2 levels

We'll be using the `crabs` dataset from the package `MASS` in this tutorial.

## Fixed one-way ANOVA with 2 or more levels

One-way ANOVAs tests whether the means of each level of a factor are different to each other or not.

```{r quiz1}
question_radio(
  "What is the null hypothesis (H0) of a one-way ANOVA?",
  answer("H0: All levels come from the same population", correct = TRUE, message = "So all levels or groups should have the same mean"),
  answer("H0: All levels represent different populations"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Sounds familiar? Should be, it's the same hypothesis as a two-sample t-test.  

One way ANOVAs consist of a continuous response variable - here we'll use carapace length (`CL`) in `crabs` - and one categorical predictor variable - we'll use `sex` (male or female) in `crabs`. You can check the structure of the data using `str()`.

Enter the `str()` function to check the structure of the crabs dataset:
```{r strcrabs, exercise = TRUE}

```

There are 100 male and 100 female crabs so 100 is the sample size within each group for a total of 200 observations. You can see that `sex` is a Factor with 2 levels `F` or `M`. Females are presented before males because female is alphabetically before males.  
The order of the levels is not important right now but it will become important if you had more predictor variables or more levels within a predictor. Or if there was a specific hypothesis you were testing that required males to be first.

## Formulating the hypothesis

Since you know the general structure of the null hypothesis of ANOVAs:

```{r hypotheses, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Hypotheses",
     question("What is our null hypothesis?",
              answer("There is no difference in mean shell length between male and female crabs", correct = TRUE),
              answer("There is a difference in mean shell length between male and female crabs"),
              answer("Male and female crabs have different shell lengths"),
              answer("Male crabs are larger than female crabs"),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              random_answer_order = TRUE
     ),
     question("What is our alternative hypothesis?",
              answer("There is a difference in mean shell length between male and female crabs", correct = TRUE),
              answer("There is no difference in mean shell length between male and female crabs"),
              answer("Male and female crabs have the same shell lengths"),
              answer("Female crabs are larger than male crabs"),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              random_answer_order = TRUE
     )
)
```

## Visualising the data

Boxplots are simple ways of visualising the centrality of observations and its spread. For a boxplot it's the median and the interquatile range. It's not exactly the same as the mean that ANOVA is testing but it's quick to see whether there are differences between groups or not.

Change this boxplot function to show carapace length of male and female crabs and press run:
```{r boxplot, exercise = TRUE}
boxplot(CW ~ sex, crabs)
```

Since boxplots don't show means we can manually check them using the function `mean()` but we need to subset the data by sex.  

> Square brackets [] allow us to subset observations based on a conditional statement. To subset based on categorical data we need to tell `R` to keep all rows of data that meet a certain criteria.   
> It takes the general structure of: data[data$variable == "criteria",]. The double `==` is important & so is the `,` at the end because the `==` tells `R` that this is a critera to match and the `,` tells `R` to look for *rows* matching the criteria.  
> If you had the `,` first, then `R` would search for *columns* matching the critera because `R` searches by columns first, then rows. 

Here is a filled in function to calculate the mean shell length of a subset of crabs by species. Replace the relevant parameters to calculate the mean shell length of female crabs (`F`).
```{r female, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}
mean(crabs[crabs$sp == "B",]$CL)
```
```{r female-hint}
What is the critera we are subsetting by?
```
```{r female-solution}
mean(crabs[crabs$sex == "F",]$CL)
```

Now do the same for male crabs 
```{r male, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```
```{r male-hint}
How would you modify the previous code to subset by males?
```
```{r male-solution}
mean(crabs[crabs$sex == "M",]$CL)
```

Do our manually calculated means correspond to the boxplot?

## ANOVA in R

> The function to do an ANOVA is `anova()` and it takes an `lm()` function because ANOVA is a type of linear regression.

Here is a partially filled code block to do an ANOVA. Fill in the missing `lm` formula and press run:
```{r lm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}
lm_crabs <- lm()
anova(lm_crabs)
```
```{r lm-hint}
What formula does lm() take?
```
```{r lm-solution}
lm(CL ~ sex, crabs)
```

Compare the output from R with the general an ANOVA table

|  Source of variation  | SS | df | MS | F | P |
|:---------------------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|---|
| Variance among groups | SSR | number of levels - 1 | $MSR = \frac{SSR}{df}$ | $\frac{MSR}{MSE}$ |   |
| Variance within group | SSE | number of observations - 2 | $MSE = \frac{SSE}{df}$|   |   |
|        Total error   | SSY | total number of observations - 1 |    |   |   |

R doesn't show you the total error row, You'll have to manually calculate it yourself.  
The first row shows the sum of squares (the variances, SSR) of our predictor variable `sex`.  
The second row shows our residuals (the difference between our linear model and the observations, SSE).  
The F value is an F test and the P-value is the P-value for the F test.

> ANOVA doesn't tell you which groups (levels) have higher or lower means, just that there is a difference in means. You need to do a posthoc test to see which groups are driving your statistical results

### Calculating the F ratio and P value

The F ratio is calculated by $F = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$. 
Use the appropriate information from the R output above to manually calculate the F ratio of our ANOVA:
```{r ratio, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

We can then calculate the P value manually using our F ratio and the degrees of freedom and the `pf()` function - for P value of the F distribution. By default the `pf()` function does a two-tailed test but we want to do a one-tailed test, specifically testing at the upper (right) tail so we tell the function to ignore the lower tail (`lower.tail = FALSE`).  

Complete the function below with the degrees of freedom of SSE and the F value (`q`) you calculated above:
```{r pvalue, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}
pf(q =, df1 = 1, df2 = , lower.tail = FALSE)
```
```{r pvalue-hint}
What is SSE in the ANOVA output?
```

Time to test our hypotheses:
```{r pvaluetest}
question_radio(
  "Based on the P value, do we accept or reject H0?",
  answer("Reject H0"),
  answer("Accept H0", correct = TRUE, message = "We can accept the null hypothesis: There is no difference in mean shell length between male and female crabs"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

We need to report our statistical test properly when writing scientific reports or papers. We report the degrees of freedom the F ratio and the P value like:  

> There is no difference in mean shell length between male and female crabs (ANOVA, $F_{1,198} = 2.20, P = 0.139$)

Here, 1 is the df of the groups (`sex`) - it always goes first - and 198 is the df of the residual error (`Residuals`).

### Understanding degrees of freedom

Degrees of freedom are a tricky concept in stats - generally they are the number of independent observations that aren't tied down by the mathematical theory underlying these tests. More importantly for us to understand in a practical setting is that they can tell you whether R has calculated the ANOVA correctly.

We expect a df of 1 for `sex` because there are two sexes. We can also calculate the total number of observations in the dataset from the degrees of freedom.

```{r df}
knitr::kable(anova(lm(CL ~ sex, rbind(MASS::crabs,MASS::crabs))), digits = 2)
question_text(
       "Based on the ANOVA table above, what is the total number of observations?",
       answer("400", correct = TRUE),
       allow_retry = TRUE
     )
```


## Calculating group means

> Remember ANOVA is a type of linear regression

We can see more information when we check `summary()`.

Here is the function to check the summary of our linear model. Fill in the missing parts of the `summary()` formula and press run:
```{r group-means, exercise = TRUE}
lm_crabs <- lm(CL ~ sex, crabs)
summary()
```

What do you think the Estimates are?

> `summary()` of an ANOVA shows the estimated means for each group (levels of a factor)

Note: As female is alphabetically before male, R has calculated the linear regression based on females. So the `(Intercept)` refers to the **group mean for females**.  

We can check this manually...

Model coefficients:  
```{r coef}
coef(lm_crabs)
```

R-calculated means: 
```{r means}
tapply(crabs$CL, crabs$sex, mean, na.rm = T)
```

We can see that the estimate for `(Intercept)` is the same as the mean shell length of female crabs.  

The second row of the `Estimate` column shows the **difference in means for males compared to females** - hence why it says `sexM`. 

Use the linear model coefficients to calculate the mean shell length of crabs. You know you got it right if the answer is `r mean(crabs[crabs$sex == "M",]$CL)`. 
```{r meanmales, exercise = TRUE}

```


## ANOVA and hypothesis testing
 
The P value for `(Intercept)` is testing for differences in the mean of females from 0 and the P value for `sexM` is testing for differences in **means between sexes** - It's the same 0.139 we calculated earlier. 

If there were more than 2 levels, then the P value of the estimated differences in group means are testing whether there is a difference in the mean of the reference level (whatever the level of the `(Intercept)` is) and the level being estimated.  

This gives you an indication of what's driving the statistical significance of the model but it's also doing multiple comparisons which isn't so good. 

> *Multiple comparisons increases the chance of making a Type I error (false positives)* so we need to account for that if we want to explore the data further - thus we use posthoc tests (not covered here). 

A one way ANOVA with two levels is the same as a t.test. Compare the ANOVA results we did above with the t-test:
```{r ttest}
anova(lm(CL ~ sex, crabs))
t.test(CL ~ sex, crabs)
```

The P value is the same! So are the group means. 

***

## Recap

* ANOVA is a test of means (analysis of variance about the mean)
* F-ratio tells you that there is a difference in the means between pairs of groups but NOT which pairs are different
* Need post-hoc tests like Tukey’s Honest Significant Differences (not covered here) to see *which pairs* are significantly different


### Exercises
Test your understanding so far by answering the questions below.
```{r recap}
knitr::kable(anova(lm(Pulse ~ Exer, survey)), digits = 3)
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "Based on the above ANOVA table, would you accept or reject the null hypothesis?",
    answer("Accept"),
    answer("Reject", correct = TRUE, message = "The P value is less than 0.05"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  "Enter is the function to conduct an Analysis of Variance in R. You don't need to include the formula. Remember to close the brackets",
  answer("anova(lm())", correct = TRUE, message = "summary(aov()) will do a Type I ANOVA as well. Type II and Type III models require additional packages"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  sprintf("How many groups were in the categorical predictor variable in this one-way analysis of variance? $F_{5,24} = 14.23, P < 0.001$"),
  answer("6", correct = TRUE, message = "The degree of freedom for group is 5 and this is calculated from the number of groups - 1. So 5 + 1 = 6"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
)
```
