# Statistical Modelling

These are interactive tutorials created using `learnr`. They are two practicals (3 hours) about experimental design and data analysis using statistical models based on functional responses.

1. Part 1 - Constructing a statistical model based on functional responses and predator-prey interactions. Design and conduct an experiment (Holling's disc equation experiment)
2. Part 2 - Analyse data collected in Part 1 using multiple linear regression. Visualise the data graphically.

These teaching materials are developed for BYU22S01 Statistics and Computation, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and provided under a CC0 license. Contact Dr Jacinta Kong for queries: [Email](mailto:kongj@tcd.ie).

The tutorials require R version 4.0 or higher.
