<h1>Welcome to Statistics and Computation for Biologists</h1>
<p>Training to become a scientist can be broken down into two parts. First, there is content to learn - these are technical details or “how to” which come from textbooks, lectures or resources on the Internet.</p>
<p>Second, is learning how to define problems and how to solve them. This is true for statistics &amp; computation. You can practice this in these drop in sessions and in your other modules. For example, R not working? Work out why, what’s wrong and what to change to make it work.</p>
<p>In this module we aim to give you the tools and knowledge to solve your own data science problems. These skills will be important in your later studies or even your career.</p>
<p>Use the following checklist to make sure you are prepared for this semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have R and RStudio installed on your computer?</li>
<li>Is your R up to date?</li>
<li>Do you know how to set up scripts and directories in RStudio?</li>
<li>Are your folders organised in a logical and sensible way?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve answered no to any of the above questions, then continue on. Some of you may already have R and RStudio installed from previous modules - that’s great! Check that your version and packages are all up to date (Under the Packages tab, click Update).</p>
<p>Regardless, you should work through this handout to make sure you are comfortable with the basics of R. Use this as a reference throughout semester as we will be revisiting these concepts.</p>

<h1 class="tabset">Installing R and RStudio</h1>
<p>R and RStudio are different software. R is a computer programming language and statistical environment. RStudio is a user interface which has some useful features that makes using R easier. If R is a retro text-based game (the ones where you chose your adventure with just words), then R studio is a graphic based game (like Legend of Zelda). It is possible to use R without RStudio but trust us, RStudio makes everything a lot easier by providing some organisation.</p>
<p>You will need to install R AND R studio <strong>in that order</strong>.</p>

<div id="why-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Why R?</h1>
<p>R is just one of <em>many</em> programming languages but R is specially designed for doing statistics. Hence it is widely taught in statistic classes. There are other statistics programs (even Excel can do basic statistical tests) but these are normally “point-and-click” programs where you click a button and magic happens. The advantage of R is that it is an open source software where you can <em>see</em> how your data is being manipulated. Which means it’s transparent, you can check whether the statistics is done correctly and is easier to see how statistical theory is being applied. It’s no longer magic but <em>science</em>.</p>
<div id="r-structure-terminology" class="section level2">
<h2>R structure &amp; terminology</h2>
<p>R can do calculations so you can use it like a calculator. More than that, R is a statistical environment that consist of <strong>packages</strong>. Packages are a set of <strong>functions</strong> that does something to input depending on the underlying code. All your packages are stored in your <strong>Library</strong>. When you download R it comes with a basic set of packages as default which works straight out of the box. This is called <strong>base R</strong>.</p>
<p>We can customise and expand the functionality of R by installing more packages, which are made by people and distributed freely. For example, I wrote this document in RStudio using an additional package called <code>Rmarkdown</code> (neat right?) which lets me make HTML, word or PDF files of text, code and figures or tables. These packages will need to be <strong>called</strong> when you open R to activate them or R will not use them. Though, where possible we will be sticking to base R.</p>
<pre><code># setup MASS 
library(MASS) # If I wanted to use the package MASS, I must enter and run the library() function at the start of my script</code></pre>
<p>Information is stored in R’s memory as <strong>variables</strong>. These can be <strong>numbers</strong> (e.g. 1, 2, 3) or <strong>strings</strong> (called characters, e.g. <code>"hello"</code>). Strings are identified by quotation marks (<code>"</code> or <code>'</code>). RStudio helpfully colour codes these different types. You can also change the colour scheme of RStudio.</p>
<p>To send information to R you can type in the function or code directly into the Console and press Enter or in a script and press Run (or Ctrl+Enter). Try typing this into the Console and pressing enter:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>2+2
[1] 4</code></pre>
<p><em>Make sure to remember to press enter. Entering in the code doesn’t execute it.</em></p>
<p>Usually information is <strong>assigned a name</strong> which we use to call later. This information is now a <strong>named variable</strong>. We assign information to a variable using a left pointing arrow <code>&lt;-</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- 2+2 # assign 2+2 to the variable called a
a
[1] 4</code></pre>
<p>Now the named variable a is stored in R’s short-term memory (called RAM - random access memory - in computing terms; also a good album by Daft Punk). This is different to long-term memory like files saved on your computer. When you close R, RAM is cleared - like your browser history when you use private mode!</p>
<p>If you enter <code>a</code> in the console it will give you the answer to <code>2+2</code> that we told it. Under the “Environment” tab, it should list <code>a</code>. <strong>Variable names are case sensitive and can be a combination of (most) symbols, letters and numbers (but no spaces).</strong></p>
<p>Variables help with simplifying our code by calling from memory. If we have another variable <code>b</code> we can add <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>b &lt;- 10
a + b
[1] 14</code></pre>
<p>We can assign strings to variables too.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c &lt;- &quot;hello&quot;
c
[1] &quot;hello&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Variables should be informative and meaningful</strong></p>
<p>Calculations of variables don’t work on strings. You can’t add strings together. Trying <code>c + a</code> should give an error.</p>
<p>Variables can store multiple pieces of information in an <strong>array</strong>. Strings and numbers cannot be mixed in the same array - they must all be the same type of data. <code>c</code> stands for concatenate (meaning link together) with your data within brackets separated by commas (spaces are optional but makes it easier to read code). We can use <code>class()</code> to see what type of variable our data are: “character” for strings, “numeric” for numbers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>string_array &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;)
string_array
[1] &quot;red&quot;   &quot;blue&quot;  &quot;green&quot;
class(string_array)
[1] &quot;character&quot;

number_array &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)
number_array
[1] 1 2 3
class(number_array)
[1] &quot;numeric&quot;

class(c(&quot;red&quot;, 1, &quot;green&quot;, 4)) # mixing strings and numbers will default to character
[1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If you manipulate the number array it will apply the calculation to all numbers. <code>*</code> is multiply. <code>/</code> is divide:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>number_array * 2
[1] 2 4 6
number_array / 10
[1] 0.1 0.2 0.3</code></pre>
<p>You can add arrays together as long as they have the same <strong>length</strong> (number of data). <code>length()</code> tells you how many observations are in the variable. <code>seq()</code> is a function to generate a sequence of numbers - here 3 evenly spaced numbers between 10 and 20:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>length(number_array)
[1] 3
number_array2 &lt;- seq(10, 20, length.out = 3)
number_array2
[1] 10 15 20

number_array + number_array2
[1] 11 17 23</code></pre>
<p>Often data is stored in multiple arrays which we can combine together to form <strong>columns</strong> and <strong>rows</strong>. This becomes a <strong>data frame</strong>. The columns have <strong>names</strong> or column headers that you can check or assign names using <code>names()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>our_data &lt;- data.frame(colo = string_array, numbr = number_array2)
our_data
   colo numbr
1   red    10
2  blue    15
3 green    20
names(our_data) # original headers
[1] &quot;colo&quot;  &quot;numbr&quot;
names(our_data) &lt;- c(&quot;colour&quot;, &quot;number&quot;) # give new names
names(our_data) # updated headers
[1] &quot;colour&quot; &quot;number&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can view some meta-information of our data in a few ways:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ncol(our_data) # the number of columns
[1] 2
nrow(our_data) # the number of rows
[1] 3
str(our_data) # summary of data types: num = numeric, chr = character
&#39;data.frame&#39;:   3 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ colour: chr  &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;green&quot;
 $ number: num  10 15 20
class(our_data) # type of variable
[1] &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now that there’s a mix of numbers and strings we cannot manipulate our data frame as a whole. Instead we need to specify which variable we want within the data frame. We use <code>$</code> to specify which column to look at by its column name:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>our_data$number
[1] 10 15 20
our_data$number * 2
[1] 20 30 40</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The bit before the $ is the name of the data frame stored in R’s memory.<br />
The bit after the $ is the name of the variable within the data frame that we want.<br />
Like: data_frame_name$variable_name<br />
This is really important to understand because it is how we tell R what information we want from it’s memory. We will see this again and again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can also specify a single cell in our data frame by referring to the column and row number in square brackets. <strong>R checks rows first then columns</strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>our_data
  colour number
1    red     10
2   blue     15
3  green     20
our_data[1,2] # First row, second column
[1] 10
our_data[2,1] # Second row, first column
[1] &quot;blue&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Omitting a number shows all values in the row or column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>our_data[,2] # second column - same as our_data$number
[1] 10 15 20
our_data[2,] # Second row
  colour number
2   blue     15</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="other-data-manipulation" class="section level2">
<h2>Other data manipulation</h2>
<p>R also has a few built in functions for various calculations. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log10(our_data$number) # log10 transformation
[1] 1.000000 1.176091 1.301030

[1] 15</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="factors" class="section level2">
<h2>Factors</h2>
<p>Sometime we need our character strings to represent categorical groups. That’s where <strong>factors</strong> come in. They are a special data class of variable consisting of groups with sub-categories (called <strong>levels</strong>). We can turn character strings into factors and vice versa by using <code>as.character()</code> or <code>as.factor()</code> and saving the output as a new variable. Let’s turn our string array into a factor:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>string_factor &lt;- as.factor(string_array)
str(string_factor) # Now we can see it is a factor and our colours have become levels (the sub-categories).
 Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;blue&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,..: 3 1 2
string_factor &lt;- as.character(string_factor)
str(string_factor) # Now it&#39;s back to a character
 chr [1:3] &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;green&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Factors are important, particularly when doing statistical hypothesis testing because it dictates the <em>order</em> in which R handles the data, otherwise R will default to ordering in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>So to summarise:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Type of data</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>R class</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>numeric</td>
<td>1,2,3</td>
<td>numeric (num)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>strings</td>
<td>“I”, “like”, “R”</td>
<td>character (chr)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>categorical (ordinal or nominal)</td>
<td>“group A”, “group B”</td>
<td>factor with levels</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can reorder the levels of a factor:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>string_factor &lt;- factor(string_array, levels = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;))
string_factor # Now you see that green is the first level
[1] red   blue  green
Levels: green blue red
string_factor &lt;- relevel(string_factor, &quot;red&quot;)
string_factor # Relevel shifts the order of factors to make the specified one first - now red is first
[1] red   blue  green
Levels: red green blue</code></pre>
<p>We can be more specific about the order too. Above those were nominal categories but we can also use ordinal categories by including <code>ordered = TRUE</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ordinal_factor &lt;- factor(c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;med&quot;, &quot;high&quot;), ordered = TRUE, levels = c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;med&quot;, &quot;high&quot;))
ordinal_factor
[1] low  med  high
Levels: low &lt; med &lt; high</code></pre>
<p>R will treat these ordered factor levels differently to unordered factor levels but the difference is not important for what we will do in this module and unordered factors levels in the order we want will be fine.</p>

<div id="commenting" class="section level2">
<h2>Commenting</h2>
<p>The <code>#</code> (hash/pound) sign indicates comments. Anything after this symbol is not run in R. It is used for commenting. Commenting is really important for writing notes or telling the user what is going on - see examples in this document. This becomes really important if you are sharing your code with someone else, including your future self.</p>

<div id="why-rstudio" class="section level1">
<h1>Why RStudio?</h1>
<p>If you open R itself you’ll see that it’s pretty bare bones. Most annoyingly you have to remember what information is stored in its memory. RStudio is a intermediate program that acts as a mediator between you and R:<br />
user -&gt; input -&gt; RStudio -&gt; R -&gt; RStudio -&gt; output -&gt; user</p>
<p>If you open RStudio you’ll see several windows that organise how information is passed to R and how output from R is presented:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacintak/biostats/master/docs/media/RStudio%20console.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Left: The big window is the <strong>console</strong>. This is the interface with R and is the same as using R on its own. (don’t worry about “terminal”)</li>
<li>Top right: This window has three tabs: “environment” - shows you what information is stored in R’s memory, “history” - shows your code history &amp; “connections” - don’t worry about this one.</li>
<li>Bottom right: This has several tabs. The most important being “files” - showing you where RStudio is looking at on your computer &amp; “plot” - shows you any plots you make in R.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can customise the layout and colour scheme of RStudio in Options.<br />
There are other user interfaces for R but RStudio has a lot of support.</p>
<div id="rstudio-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio scripts</h2>
<p>The greatest advantage of RStudio is that it allows you to write <strong>scripts</strong>. These are files ending in <code>.R</code> that are created and opened by RStudio. R itself cannot open, read or create scripts. Scripts are text documents of code that you can save on your computer and open later. They provide a guide to what you want to enter to R and saves you from <strong>having to type out code over and over again</strong>. Before RStudio, we had to save our code in notepad or similar then copy and paste it into R (believe me it was a pain). Now we can do the same but in one click. Importantly, scripts allow <strong>reproducibility</strong> and helps with problem solving.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate the power of RStudio and scripts…but first an introduction to directories.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="file-housekeeping" class="section level1">
<h1>File housekeeping</h1>
<p>It’s important for your computer files to be <em>organised</em> so that you can find your files later. Where possible don’t save your files to a “downloads” folder or your “desktop” - these should not be permanent file locations (OK for temporary ones).</p>
<p>In computer science, most operating software are organised in to <strong>drives</strong>, <strong>directories</strong>, <strong>folders</strong> &amp; <strong>files</strong>. Using Windows as example: C:/ is a drive. Within the drive there are folders (e.g. Documents). Folders are groups of files (e.g. my_document.doc). Directories are the cataloguing system describing where files and folders are stored. Directories take the form of an address like “C:/documents/folder/file” which tells a program to look in this location.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend that in your Documents folder you should have a folder for this module which contains folders for each of the practicals (5 folders). The practical folders should contain the relevant files for the practical. For example:<br />
Documents (folder) -&gt; Biostats (folder) -&gt; Practical 1 (folder) -&gt; Script (file)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of folders and files comes from the days before computers where information was written on paper and stored in filing cabinets.</p>
<p>Directories are really important concepts in computer science. We use directories without realising it every time we use a computer.</p>
<div id="working-directories" class="section level2">
<h2>Working directories</h2>
<p>RStudio works off directories. There is a default directory which shows up on the “Files” tab. This is called the <strong>Working Directory</strong>. You can change this by default under Tools -&gt; Global Options but you can also change this temporarily under Session -&gt; Set working directory.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacintak/biostats/master/docs/media/setwd.png" /></p>
<p>This is the same as entering <code>setwd(&lt;insert directory address here&gt;)</code>. It is good practice to keep similar files in the same folder. Otherwise you will need to specify the full address when you call a file that exists in another folder and it can get confusing if your files are all over the place (see below).</p>
<p>You can check what working directory R is using by typing <code>getwd()</code>. Note that if you run this from the console you might get a different answer because the default working directory of RStudio might be different to the working directory of a script. The working directory of a script is the folder the script is saved in.</p>
<p>When we type directory addresses in R we can shorten the address used <em>relative</em> to the working directory. Otherwise we would have to type in the WHOLE address starting from the disk drive (usually C:/).</p>
<p>For example:<br />
If my working directory was “C:/My Documents” and I had a file in my documents folder called “file.csv” that I wanted to load into R, then I do not need to type out “C:/My Documents/file.csv” but could use the short version “file.csv” because R automatically fills in the beginning of the address as it checks its working directory. Note directories are not case sensitive.</p>
<pre><code>C:
  -&gt; my documents (within drive C - the working directory)
      -&gt; file we want (within my documents)</code></pre>
<p>If my working directory was “G:/Folder” and my file was in “C:/my documents”, then the short version “file.csv” <em>would not work</em> because R is using the address “G:/folder/file.csv”. And this address does not exist. It’s like writing the working directory first then adding on the short address after.</p>
<pre><code>C:
  -&gt; my documents (within drive C)
      -&gt; file we want (within my documents)
G:
  -&gt; folder (within drive G - the working directory)</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of directories and addresses like postal addresses - if your address is incorrect the postman (R) wouldn’t know where to go to pick up your parcel (file)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since addresses are relative, we can also get files stored in sub folders (folders within folders) separated by <code>/</code>. Note that R can understand <code>/</code> but does not understand <code>\</code> for computer reasons we do not need to get into. If you really need to use <code>\</code> in an address you need to type it twice - e.g. <code>C:\\folder\\file</code>. Note that if you copied the address of a directory directly from the address bar in Windows Explorer then it will use <code>\</code> so you need to replace them with <code>/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>C:
  -&gt; my documents (within drive C - the working directory)
      -&gt; folder (within my documents)
          -&gt; file (within folder)</code></pre>
<p>Following the above example:<br />
If my working directory was “C:/My Documents” and I had a file in a folder within my documents folder, then the full address is “C:/My Documents/folder/file.csv” and short address I could use in R is “folder/file.csv” because R is already looking in “C:/My Documents”. This works for any number of sub-folders within the same working directory.</p>
<pre><code>C:
  -&gt; my documents (within drive C - the working directory)
      -&gt; folder 1(within my documents)
          -&gt; folder 2 (within folder 1)
              -&gt; file (within folder 2)</code></pre>
<p>E.g. “folder1/folder2/folder3/file.csv” where folder 3 is within folder 2 which is within folder 1 which is within the working directory. But you wouldn’t have that many subfolders right?</p>
<p>Now for a more complicated example. Imagine we had a folder (parent folder) with two sub-folders A &amp; B and we have set our working directory to folder A like this- <code>setwd("C:/parent folder/folder A")</code>. BUT we wanted to access a file stored in folder B (called file.csv). Like so:</p>
<pre><code>C:
  -&gt; parent folder (within drive C)
      -&gt; folder A (within parent - the working directory)
          -&gt; other files (within folder A)
      -&gt; folder B (also within parent)
          -&gt; file we want (within folder B)</code></pre>
<p>The short address “folder B/file.csv” would <strong>NOT</strong> work because the address R is using is “C:/parent folder/folder A/folder B/file.csv” which does not exist - folder B is not within folder A.<br />
Instead we have two options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To use the full address “C:/parent folder/folder B/file.csv”</li>
<li>To use the relative address and tell R to move up one directory before it starts looking for a file called “file.csv”. In computing, this is denoted <code>..</code>. So the short address becomes “../folder B/file.csv”. Use <code>..</code> each time you want to go up a directory level.e.g. “../../../file” goes up three directory levels before looking for the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s about as complicated as it gets for working directories and if you can’t import data into R - <strong>check what the working directory in R is and what the address of the file is</strong>.</p>

<div id="creating-a-script" class="section level1">
<h1>Creating a script</h1>
<p>Scripts are files of code that can be directly run in RStudio (.R files). You can create a new script under File -&gt; New file -&gt; Script (Ctrl+Shift+N) or click the white square with a green and white plus sign in the top left corner.<br />
Save it to your working directory and give it an informative name (e.g. “Dropin1”)</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacintak/biostats/master/docs/media/open%20script.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s add some code to this script. Copy and paste code from below into your script.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Run code from your script rather than directly from the console</strong>, that way you have a record of what you’ve done and it makes it easy to spot any mistakes you might have made. Put your cursor on the line you want to run then press Ctrl+Enter or click Run.</p>

</div>
<div id="loading-data" class="section level1 tabset">
<h1 class="tabset">Loading data</h1>
<p>To use data stored in other files, the data must be <strong>loaded</strong> or <strong>read</strong> into R. The function used to load data into R depends on the file type. Files names or directories are designated as character strings (<code>""</code>).</p>
<p>The function used to import data depends on the file type. <code>read.delim()</code> for deliminated data (hence delim) or <code>read.csv()</code> for csv files are two common ways. <code>read.table()</code> also works for tables. See <code>help("read.table")</code> for the general inputs. The two most important inputs to be aware of are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>header</code>: Use <code>header = FALSE</code> (default) if your data doesn’t have headers, <code>header = TRUE</code> to force R to recognise headers</li>
<li><code>sep</code>: Tells R to recognise how individual observations are separated (hence sep). <code>sep = ""</code> or <code>sep = " "</code> if it’s tab separated data (with white spaces between data - <code>""</code> is a general indicator for any whitespace, <code>" "</code> is specifically 1 space) or <code>sep = ","</code> for comma separated values. If the data didn’t import properly it could be because the wrong read function or the wrong separator was used - try another one.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Always</strong> check that your data loaded properly. Sometimes strings are loaded as factors instead of characters or vice versa. Sometimes the columns are not recognised because the separator character is incorrect. There are always simple solutions to these problems (e.g. a small typo) and you should be able to fix them.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="txt" class="section level2">
<h2>.txt</h2>
<p>Text files (.txt) tend to be delimited, meaning information is separated by a space of fixed width. e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 (separated by 1 space). This is loaded using <code>read.delim()</code>. Try loading the file “small_sleep.txt”:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>small_sleep &lt;- read.delim(&quot;../2020/drop in 1/small_sleep.txt&quot;)

<h2>.csv</h2>
<p>If data is separated by a comma, it’s called a comma separated value file (.csv). e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6. Note that .txt files can also be comma separated. The function to read csv is <code>read.csv()</code>. Try loading the file “mammal_sleep.csv”:</p>

<div id="copying-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Copying data</h2>
<p>For quick and dirty data entry, or for copying code from the Internet, you can load data from the clipboard after highlighting data and copying it. But it is always better to save a data file as a .csv file and importing into R so you always have a copy of the raw data you used.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacintak/biostats/master/docs/media/clip.png" /></p>
<p>For PC:</p>
<pre><code>myclip_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;clipboard&quot;) # also works with read.delim</code></pre>
<p>For Mac:</p>
<pre><code>myclip_data &lt;- read.csv(pipe(&quot;pbpaste&quot;)) # also works with read.delim</code></pre>

<h1>Plotting</h1>
<p>The base R function to make a plot is <code>plot(y axis ~ x axis, data = data frame)</code>. You can customise all components of the graph - try looking up how to change the point style.</p>

<p>If you want a challenge, try replicating this figure using the <code>mammal_sleep</code> dataset:</p>

<p>I won’t tell you how but by the end of the module you should be able to make figures that are suitable for scientific reports - not implying that the figure above is a standard.</p>

<h1>Tips</h1>
<ul>
<li>Coding is like learning a language. There is grammar, syntax and terminology to learn.</li>
<li>The secret to being a coding whiz is practice, practice, practice. Try using R at every opportunity. If you don’t use it, you lose it.</li>
<li>It’s OK to google everything. No matter how many years you’ve been using R you will forget something basic.</li>
<li>A lot of programming is logic. If you can’t describe what you want to achieve in words, then you can’t code it. Sometimes the solution means changing your way of thinking about a problem.</li>
<li>A lot of errors come from spelling or syntax mistakes. It doesn’t mean you don’t know it, check your code carefully for typos. Missing brackets or quotation marks are common mistakes.</li>
<li>Often, copying and pasting your error message into google comes up with the solution</li>
<li>Trial and error is a big part of programming. If it doesn’t work the first time, tweak it and try it again. Getting a function to work might be as simple as adding or removing one of the defined parameters.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="finding-help" class="section level1">
<h1>Finding help</h1>
<p>All R code comes with help files. You can access them from the “Help” tab in RStudio. If you want help on a specific function, then you can type in <code>help(&lt;insert function name here&gt;)</code>. If you don’t know your exact query, you can search using <code>??&lt;insert term here&gt;</code> - e.g. <code>??mean</code>.</p>
<p>The Internet is really really great for R help. Websites like StackExchange are help forums for programming. Most likely your question has already been answered on StackExchange. The trick is knowing what to type into Google.</p>
<p>Learning to problem solve independently is not something you learn by reading or something you can be taught. It is a skill you have to learn by <em>doing</em>, which means having a go yourself before seeking help from others. Make asking for help your last option. You’ll see on StackExchange people <em>describe</em> what they want to achieve, what they have done so far, identified what the problem is and provide some reproducible code to help someone else understand their problem. It’s really hard to fix someone’s coding problem without context.</p>
